# CalAlarmDart

Note: üçù  code ahead. 

A Dart version of the [CalAlarm](https://github.com/Evgastap/CalAlarm) app.

While making the above version, I at least knew a little bit about what Java is.

Here, I dive head-first into not knowing what the hell I'm doing, but since I read somewhere that Dart was the future, I decided to try it.

Does it work? Absolutely not.

Is the code pretty and organised? Well, let me give you a hint - I basically didn't do any programming before starting this.
